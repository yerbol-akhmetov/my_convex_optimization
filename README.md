# Welcome to My Convex Optimization
***

## Task
The task is to learn different optimization algorithms such as gradient descent, newton-raphson methods that helps to minimize (maximize) given functions.

## Description
The problem is solved by creating functions that find the root of the function based on, namely 1) bisection method, 2) newton-raphson method, 3) gradient descent method. In addition, a function is written that optimizes given function based on inequality constraints.

## Installation
There is no need for an explicit installation. However, the code can be executed using "python my_convex_optimization.py" command.

## Usage
The functions inside of the project can be directly copied into required python notebooks, or they can be imported using import commands.
